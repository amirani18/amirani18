## Hi there 👋

I'm Areej, an aspiring software engineer from Missoula, Montana.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as an Nuclear IT Data Science Analyst at @Nextera Energy. 🌱 

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science and engineering. I also love running, working on cars, and dabbling in the occasional watch party for the NBA and NHA.
